**Download link to IntelliJ** https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

**Download link to Visual Studio** https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/


## Important Notes for Learning

**Primitive data types -** includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char

**Non-primitive data types -** such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)

**Type Casting**

int myInt = 9;

double myDouble = myInt;

or,

double myDouble = 9.78d;

int myInt = (int) myDouble;

**Java Special Characters**

Backslash (\) is used to add quotes inside quotes such as "This is \"Java\" Learning"

\n is used for new line. \t is used for tab.

**For Loop**

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

System.out.println(i);

}


String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

for (String i : cars) {

System.out.println(i);

}

**ARRAY**

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};

cars[0] = "Opel";

System.out.println(cars[0]);

System.out.println(cars.length);
